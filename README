Crimson Backup is the backup system which integrates with the Crimson Pyramid system.  Due to its complexity, it's a separate component.  
You must use the Crimson Pyramid system - and, in particular, have a CP database - in order to use Crimson Backup.  You need not, however, use Crimson Backup to use the other components of Crimson Pyramid.
